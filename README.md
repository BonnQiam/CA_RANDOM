Welcome to the Stochastic Metacellular Automata Generation project! The primary focus of this project is on generating strongly stochastic non-uniform two-dimensional metacellular automata using evolutionary algorithms.

# Content

- Randomer_list_w8_h8, Randomer_list_w19_h19: This directory contains current non-uniform 2D tuple automata (Neumann neighborhood) generated by evolutionary algorithms, demonstrating good results in diehard stochasticity tests.
- Rule_GA: Here you'll find evolutionary algorithms and generated non-uniform 2D tuple automata with Neumann neighborhoods.
- Rule_handcraft: This section is dedicated to generating 2D tuple automata by randomly distributing certain rules within the Neumann neighborhood.
- Nonuniform_CA_2D_Moore.py, Nonuniform_CA_2D_Neumann.py: These scripts are used for the generation of random numbers from nonuniform 2D tuple automata, with options for Moore or Neumann neighborhoods.
